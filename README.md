# ðŸ§© Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction

This repository serves as the foundation for documenting and understanding the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
It focuses on identifying, analyzing, and documenting the requirements for a Booking Management Systemâ€”simulating a real-world development scenario.

### The primary goal of this project is to:

- Understand how requirements are gathered, categorized, and validated.

- Develop structured documentation for both functional and non-functional requirements.

- Create clear visual representations using tools like Draw.io.

- Define acceptance criteria that align with technical implementation with business objectives.

This repository will evolve through multiple tasks, each highlighting a critical step in mastering the requirement analysis process and producing industry-standard documentation for scalable software systems.
