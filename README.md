# ðŸ§© Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction

This repository serves as the foundation for documenting and understanding the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
It focuses on identifying, analyzing, and documenting the requirements for a Booking Management Systemâ€”simulating a real-world development scenario.

### The primary goal of this project is to:

- Understand how requirements are gathered, categorized, and validated.

- Develop structured documentation for both functional and non-functional requirements.

- Create clear visual representations using tools like Draw.io.

- Define acceptance criteria that align with technical implementation with business objectives.

This repository will evolve through multiple tasks, each highlighting a critical step in mastering the requirement analysis process and producing industry-standard documentation for scalable software systems.

## ðŸ’¡ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a vital phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for all subsequent stages of the project. A well-defined requirement analysis ensures that developers, stakeholders, and users share a unified understanding of the systemâ€™s goals and expectations.
Below are three key reasons why this phase is critical:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep

Requirement analysis bridges the communication gap between stakeholders and the development team. Clearly defined requirements help prevent misunderstandings, minimize rework, and reduce the risk of scope creep, by ensuring that the final product aligns with the clientâ€™s expectations.

### 2. Saves Time and Cost

By identifying potential issues early and defining the systemâ€™s needs precisely, requirement analysis minimizes design errors, development delays, and costly post-deployment fixes. This proactive approach ensures resources are used efficiently throughout the project lifecycle.

### 3. Serves as a Blueprint for Development

Requirement analysis produces structured documentation; including functional, non-functional, and user requirements, that guides developers, testers, and designers. This blueprint ensures consistency, improves collaboration, and forms the basis for validation and acceptance testing.
