# üß© Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction

This repository serves as the foundation for documenting and understanding the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
It focuses on identifying, analyzing, and documenting the requirements for a Booking Management System‚Äîsimulating a real-world development scenario.

### The primary goal of this project is to:

- Understand how requirements are gathered, categorized, and validated.

- Develop structured documentation for both functional and non-functional requirements.

- Create clear visual representations using tools like Draw.io.

- Define acceptance criteria that align with technical implementation with business objectives.

This repository will evolve through multiple tasks, each highlighting a critical step in mastering the requirement analysis process and producing industry-standard documentation for scalable software systems.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

* **Clarity and Understanding:** It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
* **Scope Definition:** Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
* **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
* **Cost and Time Estimation:** Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
* **Quality Assurance:** Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### 1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è

* **Interviews:** Conduct interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
* **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Distribute surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
* **Workshops:** Organize workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
* **Observation:** Observe end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
* **Document Analysis:** Review existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è

* **Brainstorming:** Conduct brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
* **Focus Groups:** Hold focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
* **Prototyping:** Create prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

### 3. Requirement Documentation üìö

* **Requirement Specification Document:** Create a detailed document listing all functional and non-functional requirements.
* **User Stories:** Write user stories to describe functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.
* **Use Cases:** Create use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä

* **Requirement Prioritization:** Prioritize requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
* **Feasibility Analysis:** Assess feasibility in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
* **Modeling:** Create models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

### 5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ

* **Review and Approval:** Review documented requirements with stakeholders for accuracy and completeness.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Define clear acceptance criteria for each requirement.
* **Traceability:** Establish traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

**Definition:** Describe what the system should do.

**Examples:** User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

**Key Functional Requirements:**

* Search Properties: Users can search for properties by location, price, and availability.
* User Registration: Users can create accounts with personal details and login credentials.
* Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
* Booking System: Users can book properties, view booking details, and manage bookings.
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration process.

### Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è

**Definition:** Describe how the system should perform.

**Examples:** Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

**Key Non-functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:** The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1,000 concurrent users.
* **Security:** Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protection against vulnerabilities.
* **Scalability:** The system should scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
* **Usability:** The application should have an intuitive UI/UX for easy navigation.
* **Reliability:** Maintain 99.9% uptime and quick recovery from failures.

## Requirement Analysis Process

1. **Requirement Gathering:** Engage stakeholders and collect initial requirements through interviews, surveys, and workshops.
2. **Requirement Elicitation:** Refine and elaborate requirements using brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.
3. **Requirement Documentation:** Document requirements in a structured format ‚Äî specification docs, user stories, and use cases.
4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyze and prioritize requirements; create models for visualization and understanding.
5. **Requirement Validation:** Review and validate requirements, define acceptance criteria, and ensure traceability.

## üí° Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a vital phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for all subsequent stages of the project. A well-defined requirement analysis ensures that developers, stakeholders, and users share a unified understanding of the system‚Äôs goals and expectations.
Below are three key reasons why this phase is critical:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep

Requirement analysis bridges the communication gap between stakeholders and the development team. Clearly defined requirements help prevent misunderstandings, minimize rework, and reduce the risk of scope creep, by ensuring that the final product aligns with the client‚Äôs expectations.

### 2. Saves Time and Cost

By identifying potential issues early and defining the system‚Äôs needs precisely, requirement analysis minimizes design errors, development delays, and costly post-deployment fixes. This proactive approach ensures resources are used efficiently throughout the project lifecycle.

### 3. Serves as a Blueprint for Development

Requirement analysis produces structured documentation; including functional, non-functional, and user requirements, that guides developers, testers, and designers. This blueprint ensures consistency, improves collaboration, and forms the basis for validation and acceptance testing.
