## üí° Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a vital phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for all subsequent stages of the project. A well-defined requirement analysis ensures that developers, stakeholders, and users share a unified understanding of the system‚Äôs goals and expectations.
Below are three key reasons why this phase is critical:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep

Requirement analysis bridges the communication gap between stakeholders and the development team. Clearly defined requirements help prevent misunderstandings, minimize rework, and reduce the risk of scope creep, by ensuring that the final product aligns with the client‚Äôs expectations.

### 2. Saves Time and Cost

By identifying potential issues early and defining the system‚Äôs needs precisely, requirement analysis minimizes design errors, development delays, and costly post-deployment fixes. This proactive approach ensures resources are used efficiently throughout the project lifecycle.

### 3. Serves as a Blueprint for Development

Requirement analysis produces structured documentation; including functional, non-functional, and user requirements, that guides developers, testers, and designers. This blueprint ensures consistency, improves collaboration, and forms the basis for validation and acceptance testing.

## Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?
A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of how different users (called *actors*) interact with a system to achieve specific goals (*use cases*).  
It helps in identifying the functionalities the system must support and clarifies relationships between users and system features.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- **Clarifies System Scope:** Helps both developers and stakeholders understand what the system will and won‚Äôt do.  
- **Improves Communication:** Provides a clear and simple visual tool for discussing system interactions.  
- **Identifies Actors and Use Cases:** Makes it easy to visualize which users perform which actions.  
- **Facilitates Requirement Validation:** Ensures all key functionalities are captured and aligned with business needs.
